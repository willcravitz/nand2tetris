/**
 * Memory of 64 registers, each 16 bit-wide. Out holds the value
 * stored at the memory location specified by address. If load==1, then 
 * the in value is loaded into the memory location specified by address 
 * (the loaded value will be emitted to out from the next time step onward).
 *
 * Identical structure to RAM8 but scaled up
